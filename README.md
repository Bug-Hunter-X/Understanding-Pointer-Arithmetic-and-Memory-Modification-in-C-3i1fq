# Understanding Pointer Arithmetic and Memory Modification in C

This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates a common error related to pointers and memory modification. The `bug.c` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.c` provides the correct approach.

## The Bug

The primary issue lies in the misunderstanding of how pointers interact with memory. The code unintentionally modifies the value of `x` via a pointer.

## The Solution

The solution clarifies the correct usage of pointers for memory manipulation. It illustrates safe pointer arithmetic and how to handle memory allocation efficiently.

## Lessons Learned

* Understand how pointers affect variable values.
* Avoid memory leaks and segmentation faults by proper pointer management.
* Practice safe pointer arithmetic to ensure memory safety.
